What is all this stuff about?
========

This is the sourcecode repository of http://what-day-is.it/ a **very** simple website, that tells you the day of the week.
I needed this website because I am a stupid student, who forgets about time and space all the time.

The site uses the time of your computer as well as your IP-based location to determine the current day.
